# ðŸ”Ž Issues & Problems with Current Code (based on notebook outputs)

### 1. **Overfitting**
- Training accuracy is high but validation accuracy diverges.
- Suggestion â†’ Add more augmentation, dropout, weight decay, or use pretrained models.

### 2. **Class Imbalance**
- TB images are fewer â†’ model struggles to distinguish TB vs Pneumonia.
- Suggestion â†’ Balanced sampling or synthetic oversampling.

### 3. **Limited Metrics**
- Only accuracy is shown in some outputs.
- Suggestion â†’ Always report **Precision, Recall, F1** (important in healthcare, esp. for false negatives).

### 4. **Explainability Missing**
- No saliency / Grad-CAM visualizations to show model reasoning.
- Doctors will need interpretability before trusting predictions.

### 5. **Ethical Risks**
- Model might generalize poorly on data from different hospitals/patient demographics.
- Could reinforce healthcare disparities if not tested broadly.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to also create a **requirements.txt** (based on the imports in your notebook) so your repo is fully reproducible?
